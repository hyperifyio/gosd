Simple virtual server and container manager

## Overview

`gosd` offers a streamlined approach to managing virtual servers and 
containerized applications on FreeBSD, Linux, and potentially more platforms in 
the future. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, it allows users to set up 
and maintain a hosting environment with minimal overhead. `gosd` leverages 
`podman` for container management, providing a user-friendly CLI and REST API 
to facilitate operations without complex configuration.

## Development

`gosd` is currently in the development stage and is not yet a fully functioning 
application. We welcome you to track our progress and contribute to the 
discussion by visiting 
[our issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/hyperifyio/gosd/issues/1). 
Your feedback is invaluable as we work towards completing `gosd`.

## Getting Started

(TODO: Instructions on installing, configuring, and using `gosd` will be added 
here.)

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Initially available on MacOS and Linux, with 
  Windows support planned for the future.

- **Container Management**: Uses `podman` for managing containers effectively 
  in the host virtual server environment.

- **Simplified Interface**: A straightforward command-line interface and REST 
  API for easy management tasks.

- **Versatile Hosting**: Suitable for both physical and cloud deployments, 
  offering flexibility in how and where it's used.

- **Future Expansion**: Plans to support a wider range of host systems to 
  accommodate diverse hosting needs.

- **Accessible Control**: Manageable via CLI across MacOS, Linux, and 
  eventually Windows systems, ensuring wide usability.

## Planned Features

(TODO: A concise list of upcoming features focusing on simplicity and 
practicality in managing software with containers.)
